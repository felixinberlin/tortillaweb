## 2025-02-27 - PollComponent Accessibility
**Learning:** Found interactive poll options disguised as `div`s with `onClick` handlers. While they function for mouse users, they break keyboard navigation and screen readers don't understand their state.
**Action:** Replaced `div` with native `<button>`, implemented semantic layout preservation (`w-full text-left`), and added `aria-pressed` for screen readers alongside keyboard focus states.
